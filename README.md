## Description :scroll:

    This Website based game that prompts 3 different time table modes (1-5's, 1-10's, and 1-15's) that gives you random multiplication questions to answer as fast as possible
    - The goal of this program is to build better muscle memory for your multiplication tables (if you don't already know them)

## Requirements :wrench:

- WiFi lol :)

## Installation :floppy_disk:

*insert site link here (Site WIP)*

## TODO (Eventually) :eyes:

~~- Make an optional timer per question~~
- make a mode to see how many you can get within a certain time limit

- have some sort of congratulations per so many questions correct
- Make an optional question limit that gets larger with shorter times as you progress through the game (basically lives)

- setup a website to put this on 
- use CSS to make it look good and have a box to run the python 

- remake all of it in Javascript or rust...
    - but first i gotta learn those üòê
